That is a chatbot, implemented using Recurrent Neural Networks with LSTM and attention mechanisms.
Was trained on the cornell_movie_dialog database

In order to speak with a chatbot, download the trained model by the link in the <strong>/models/cornell_movie_dialog/README.md</strong> first and unzip it to the cornell_movie_dialog folder.

Then, use Anaconda Prompt to start a dialog using <br>
<code>python chat.py models\cornell_movie_dialog\trained_model_v1\best_weights_training.ckpt</code>
